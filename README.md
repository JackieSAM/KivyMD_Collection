# KivyMD Collection

This is a tutorial with examples of beautiful and modern applications for mobile devices with detailed documentation,
which describes step by step the process of creating applications and their components using the [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) framework and the [KivyMD](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) library.

The KivyMD Collection app is **shareware** software in the sense that we are not engaged in commercial activities
and do not set ourselves the goal of making money through this application. KivyMD Collection was created
only to popularize the Kivy framework and develop the KivyMD library.

# Why not free

In 2015, the author of the library [Andrés Rodríguez](https://github.com/mixedCase) stopped working on the KivyMD project.
The library did not develop for three years. In 2018, we made a decision that we should take over the further development of KivyMD.
After two years of our efforts, the popularity of the library is only increasing every day,
the number of users is growing, hundreds of questions are being asked in user support channels. And it turned out that two main
the developer of the KivyMD library is simply physically unable to provide normal assistance to users
and at the same time maintain the development of the library at the proper level.

We have created an [open collective](https://opencollective.com/kivymd) to collect voluntary donations for the development of the KivyMD library (thanks to everyone who supports us),
but at the moment, unfortunately, the funds raised are not enough for us to devote all our time to the development of KivyMD.
Therefore, we cannot fix all the errors in the library and add new functions. To increase the activity of backers,
we created the KivyMD Collection application for them. Actually, this is our small thanks for their contribution to the development
of such a useful library as KivyMD.

# How it works

You install the KivyMD Collection application on your computer. After installation, you have access to:

- an example of creating a mobile mini application
- an example of creating a card for a mobile application
- an example of animation by a widget for the KivyMD library

All examples are accompanied by detailed documentation. Three new examples will be available every month
provided that you make a monthly contribution (of any amount) to the development of the KivyMD library in the [open collective](https://opencollective.com/kivymd).

# Installation

Download the package for your system, install as a normal application and run:

# How to run an AppImage

Before you can run an AppImage, you need to make it executable. This is a Linux security feature.
There are three main ways to make an AppImage executable:

### 1. With the GUI

1. Open your file manager and browse to the location of the AppImage
2. Right-click on the AppImage and click the `Properties` entry
3. Switch to the Permissions tab and
4. Click the `Allow executing file as program` checkbox if you are using a Nautilus-based file manager (Files, Nemo, Caja), 
or click the `Is executable` checkbox if you are using Dolphin, or change the `Execute` drop down list to `Anyone` if you are using PCManFM.
5. Close the dialog
6. Double-click on the AppImage file to run

  </a>
</p>

### 2. On the command line

`chmod a+x Some.AppImage`

### 3. Automatically with the optional appimaged daemon

If you would like to have all AppImages be executable automatically, you can install the optional appimaged daemon.
It will automatically add downloaded AppImages to the menu and make them executable for you. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases or installed from your distribution.

# How to install use `*dmg` file

Since we do not have a developer certificate, most likely the application for Mac OS will be blocked by the system.

### Other ways to open blocked apps

Another way to open a blocked app is to locate the app in a Finder window.

1. Open the Finder.
2. Locate the app (it might be in the Applications folder, or it might still be in your downloads folder).
3. `Ctrl-Click` or right-click on the app.

  </a>
</p>

4. Select Open from the resultant menu and the app will be opened anyway, and an exception will be created for opening it normally (i.e. by double-clicking) in future.
